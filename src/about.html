                        <p>
                            This hackathon is part of a media museum’s experimental tech exhibit, making it radically
                            different from other hackathons. 
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            We're talking about  <a class="white-link" href="https://open-codes.zkm.de/en"
                                                    target="_blank">Open Codes - Living in Digital Worlds</a> of the
                            <a class="white-link" href="http://zkm.de/en" target="_blank">ZKM</a> in Karlsruhe. It features
                            a variety of cutting-edge toys and gadgets, from VR goggles to mind-blowing interactive digital art.
                            The exhibit sheds light on the world of devs, designers and makers, making the tech community more
                            accessible to the general public.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            Even though daily life without technology is nowadays unthinkable for the vast majority of people,
                            the background story – how it is created, who creates it, who can learn to create
                            it- still has a tough entry barrier.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            We wanted to help change that. To do so, we needed something new. We had to
                            <span style="color: #FF3524">rethink</span> our hackathon.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            So we came up with a new approach: we make sure everyone, meaning techies as well as the
                            general public, is welcome at the OpenCodes Hackathon. Museum visitors will see that that the
                            stereotypical computer scientist – a lanky man wearing glasses, sitting in a dark room with
                            his hood up and speaking an average of two hundred words a day – does not do justice to the
                            actual tech community. Visitors will be captured by the electrifying atmosphere
                            of hackathons, nurtured by the competitor’s passion and driven by their innovation.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            We want to show non-tech people what tech is really about. We want to fascinate them with
                            tech. We want to inspire them to join our ranks as hackers.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            Join us and play a part in this uncommon experiment.

                            We want to motivate as many people as possible to join the hacking community. We want to
                            provide an event where young hackers can work on their own pet projects, while experienced
                            hackers can compete for prizes in ambitious categories.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            We want to unite participants from all kinds of backgrounds. We want designers,
                            organizers and artists to join the community of hackers and makers.
                            We want people to pour all their creativity into their project in an inspiring environment.

                            with its ever changing and truly unique exhibits. In its small niche it has gained global
                            attention, in fact the New York Times dubbed as “an institution that has no exact
                            parallel in the world and not even a recognizable echo in America."

                            A perfect place for a hackathon.

                            We're a German student-run nonprofit organisation
                            focused all around coding and
                            hacking. We try to bring a bit of silicon valley to the german
                            computer-science and start-up community by disrupting the status quo. We do this by
                            organising hackathons, coding boot camps
                            and other similar events.
                            Our team consists of students from a variety of
                            backgrounds: Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, Economics, Business, and
                            more.</p>

                            We do the doing, talKIT does the talking. It's an amazing tech conference where people from
                            all kinds of backgrounds come together to discuss one big topic. This year it's AI & cybersecurity,
                            so get pumped!
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            TalKIT takes a look at this topic from many different angles, not just tech. It's a great
                            experience and tons of fun. However you should know that the entire event is in German.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            Further more, the winners of the hackathon are invited to join the talKIT conference and
                            present their project. If you've got questions about them, please hit them up here.
