                    <p>
                        This hackathon is part of a media museum’s experimental tech exhibit, making it radically
                        different from other hackathons. 
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        We're talking about  <a class="white-link" href="https://open-codes.zkm.de/en"
                                                target="_blank">Open Codes - Living in Digital Worlds</a> of the
                        <a class="white-link" href="http://zkm.de/en" target="_blank">ZKM</a> in Karlsruhe. It features
                        a variety of cutting-edge toys and gadgets, from VR goggles to mind-blowing interactive digital art.
                        The exhibit sheds light on the world of devs, designers and makers, making the tech community more
                        accessible to the general public.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        Even though daily life without technology is nowadays unthinkable for the vast majority of people,
                        the background story – how it is created, who creates it, who can learn to create
                        it - still has a tough entry barrier.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        We wanted to help change that. To do so, we needed something new. We had to
                        <span style="color: #FF3524">rethink</span> our hackathon.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        So we came up with a new approach: we make sure everyone, meaning techies as well as the
                        general public, is welcome at the OpenCodes Hackathon. Museum visitors will see that the
                        stereotypical computer scientist – a lanky man wearing glasses, sitting in a dark room with
                        his hood up and speaking an average of two hundred words a day – does not do justice to the
                        actual tech community. Visitors will be captured by the electrifying atmosphere
                        of hackathons, nurtured by the competitor’s passion and driven by their innovation.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        We want to show non-tech people what tech is really about. We want to fascinate them with
                        tech. We want to inspire them to join our ranks as hackers.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        Join us and be a part of this uncommon experiment.

                        organize an event where young hackers can work on their own pet projects, while experienced
                        hackers can compete for prizes in ambitious categories.

                        We want to unite participants from all kinds of backgrounds. We want designers,
                        organizers and artists to join the community of hackers and makers.
                        We want people to pour all their creativity into their project in an inspiring environment.

                        with its regularly changing, one-of-a-kind exhibits. In its small niche, it has gained global
                        attention. In fact the New York Times dubbed it as “an institution that has no exact
                        parallel in the world and not even a recognizable echo in America."

                        focused on coding and
                        hacking. We try to bring a bit of Silicon Valley to the German
                        computer-science and start-up community by disrupting the status quo. We do this by
                        organizing hackathons, coding boot camps
                        and other similar events.

                        so get pumped!

                        TalKIT takes a look at this topic from many different angles, not just tech. It's a great
                        experience and tons of fun. However, be aware that the entire talKIT conference is in German, while the hackathon is in English.

                        We did a little design competition and a team from the local design school won with their project called 'Brainbow'.<br/>
                        Leonie Lude, Karla Kniep and Sven Krahl came up with the idea, which is much more than a simple design.
