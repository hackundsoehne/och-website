                        While organizing our schedule we chose quality over quantity. We are convinced that a few exciting,
                        hand-picked talks make a great hackathon while not distracting you from actually working on your project.

                                    about unimportant stuff, so we'll keep it as short as possible!
                                        In these 45 minutes, we'll tell you everything you need to know to have a perfect hackathon.
                                        What are the categories? What the prizes? Where can I ask questions? Who are the sponsors? Where are the toilets?
                                        No matter what, we'll cover it all.... and if not, just hit up one of us in the red hoodies.

                                    You'll get the chance to convince one of our 7 jury members of your idea, to make it into the final round.
                                    This process allows the jury members to get a deep insight into your projects, ponder your ideas and evaluate on
                                    a solid basis instead of just judging from a 5 minute pitch.</p>
