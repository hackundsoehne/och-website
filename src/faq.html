                            very excited if you can make it to the event, however as we only have a limited budget and many
                            excellent applicants we cannot offer any more reimbursements.

                        <p>Everyone needs some sleep, even at hackathons. We are prepared and have a little quite
                            room where people can take a nap. However, we do not provide any sleeping equipment, so
                            please bring a sleeping bag or whatever you need to sleep comfortably.
