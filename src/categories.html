                        Our main category is completely open, you can do whatever you want.

                        There's only one rule: Don't start working on your project until the hackathon begins.
                        You can research it, overthink it or even bother your already annoyed neighbours with it.
                        Just don't get a head start on anyone else.

                        For those looking to solve more specific problems, there are the three very interesting categories powered by our partners.

                                <p>The ZKM focuses on strengthening the ties between science, technology and art. In this hackathon, we want to dive into the relationship between information and the code-driven representation of it. This category gives you a chance to experiment, to combine your technical skills with a creative thinking.

                                    Our world is increasingly connected and captured: millions of sensors collect billions of measurements, while users generate more and more data input on a daily basis. Our way of reasoning and rationalising, the way in which we think about the world, is by analysing this data.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Show us the art hidden inside datasets, the abstract connections and correlations through new ways of data representation and handling. Do not stick to the well-known paths of existing tools and schemes, but look into how you can take an unconventional or new path. How can we represent and interpret data differently? What new relationships can we explore? How can we change our understanding of certain things by representing data differently?</p>

                                Contribute by exploring new ways of connecting people through technology. Build something awesome that simplifies communication, enables collaboration, or brings people closer together. Be creative, you can build anything you want.

                                <br>
                                The only thing that matters: Create something from which your friends, family, club or society as a whole can benefit. Happiness comes from solving problems. You decide which problems to solve and which technology to use. Build an app, a website, an integrated service or anything else you can come up with.
                                <br>

You can win our hearts and the prize by developing a stunning prototype, a creative concept or even a breakthrough idea. If you need any help at all, e.g. finding the right idea, feel free to come by our booth at ZKM during the hackathon.

                                <p>In a world that grows more volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous, integration is the key to cope with the challenges arising with every new possibility. So, we are looking for inventive ways to combine two different worlds that don't seem to naturally belong together. For example, in a smart city, millions of devices need to communicate not only with each other, but also bring information from the material world into the digital. To build new solutions in mobility and transport, we have to cross borders in a technical sense as well as in the user's experience. To live peacefully in a global society, we have to embrace and integrate different cultures and enable decentralized communities, grids and communication. 
								<br>
								<br>
								There are no limits in our challenge, you can connect any worlds in the technological way you want to, as long as it's a further step towards a more connected future, enabling cutting-edge use cases, or making new things possible within the old. We value passion, creativity in applying technologies, novelty and disruptive potential, but also outstanding  teamwork. The winner of our challenge can look forward to hacker-approved prizes. 
								<br>
								<br>
								To help you build the technology of tomorrow, we provide you with useful APIs and data. Come to our booth to get an introduction or help from our experts. Let's shape the future by connecting worlds!
