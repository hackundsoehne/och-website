                        There's only one rule: Don't start working on your project until the hackathon begins.
                        You can research it, overthink it or even bother your already annoyed neighbours with it.
                        Just don't start too early.

                                Your contribution comes from exploring new ways of connecting people through technology. Build something awesome that simplifies communication, enables collaboration, or just brings people closer together. This can be anything that you can imagine.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                The only thing that matters: Create something from which your friends, family, club or society as a whole can benefit. Happiness comes from solving problems. You decide which technology you choose to build an app, website, integrating service… You think of more than that? Feel free.
                                <br>
                                <br>

                                <p>In a world that grows more volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous, integration
                                    is the key to cope with the challenges arising with every new possibility. So, we
                                    are looking for inventive ways to combine technologies, business sectors, value
                                    chains, ecosystems, data, assets or even cultures.

                                    Big ideas need a lot of bridging between things that don't seem to naturally belong together: in a smart city,
                                    millions of devices need to communicate not only with each other, but also bring
                                    information from the material world into the digital. To build new solutions in
                                    mobility and transport, we have to cross borders in a technical sense as well as
                                    in the user's experience. To live peacefully in a global society, we have to embrace
                                    and integrate different cultures and enable decentral communities, grids and communication.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    We want you to build the first step towards a more connected future,
                                    enabling cutting-edge use cases, or making new things possible within the
                                    old. We value passion, creativity in applying technologies, novelty and
                                    disruptive potential, but also outstanding teamwork. The winner of our challenge
                                    can look forward to hacker-approved prizes.
