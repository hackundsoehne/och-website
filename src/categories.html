                        There's only one rule: Don't start working on your project until the hackathon begins.
                        You can research it, overthink it or even bother your already annoyed neighbours with it.
                        Just don't get a head start on anyone else.

                                <p>In a world that grows more volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous, integration
                                    is the key to cope with the challenges arising with every new possibility. So, we
                                    are looking for inventive ways to combine technologies, business sectors, value
                                    chains, ecosystems, data, assets or even cultures.

                                    Big ideas need a lot of bridging between things that don't seem to naturally belong together: in a smart city,
                                    millions of devices need to communicate not only with each other, but also bring
                                    information from the material world into the digital. To build new solutions in
                                    mobility and transport, we have to cross borders in a technical sense as well as
                                    in the user's experience. To live peacefully in a global society, we have to embrace
                                    and integrate different cultures and enable decentralized communities, grids and communication.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    We want you to build the first step towards a more connected future,
                                    enabling cutting-edge use cases, or making new things possible within the
                                    old. We value passion, creativity in applying technologies, novelty and
                                    disruptive potential, but also outstanding teamwork. The winner of our challenge
                                    can look forward to hacker-approved prizes.
