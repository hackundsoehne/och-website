                        Where do apps come from? What is it like to program? Unfortunately for most of us programming
                        is more black magic than anything else. Year by year we become more reliant on technology,
                        and as we do so, it becomes increasingly important for everyone to understand what is going on
                        underneath.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        And yet few people do. To change that, we want to show you something special.
                        Something so unique and out of the this world that we promise you've never seen anything like it
                        before.

                        Inside the <a class="white-link" href="http://zkm.de/en" target="_blank">ZKM</a>, in the fantastic
                        <a class="white-link" href="https://open-codes.zkm.de/en" target="_blank">Open Codes - Living in Digital Worlds</a> exhibit, our hackathon, a sort of inventors
                        competition, takes place.
                        Various teams will work under pressure to bring their ideas to life in the form of a prototype,
                        and they only have 28 hours to do so.
                        Yes, that often means no sleep!
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        But wait, they work in the most stunning environment you've ever come across. Hackathon
                        participants always get free food, free drinks, free shirts, free stickers, free stuff all the
                        way, and sometimes even free massages. They are places where you meet incredible people,
                        mind-blowing companies and above all, where you have the time of your life.
                        <br>

                        Does that intrigue you? If so, yes, this is for you. Come by and visit.

                    <p>
                        People that go to a hackathon are called hackers. And no, they are not people that will steal
                        your bank account information. Instead they are people who enjoy the intellectual challenge of
                        creatively overcoming barriers. They want to come up with novel solutions that yield clever
                        results. In other words, they like to solve puzzles, and it doesn't have to be done through
                        code. Anything can be a hack, that's what it's all about.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Of course solving puzzles is hard work, and with hard work comes a need for lots of fuel.
                        Participating in
                        a hackathon also means getting lots of free food, free drinks and other free stuff. It is a core
                        element of the culture, and is one reason why hackathons are so fun.

                        The rules are simple: The teams have 28 hours to build their idea, and are not allowed to start
                        working until the hackathon begins. Final results are judged under various criteria including
                        originality of the idea and quality of the implementation.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        What sets us apart from other hackathons is that we don't restrict the projects
                        of our participants to a certain topic (like healthcare or industry 4.0), but rather encourage
                        any out-side-of-the-box ideas. Even more unique is the deep cooperation with the
                        <a class="white-link" href="http://zkm.de/en" target="_blank">ZKM</a>. We encourage our
                        participants not only to create interesting tech, but also combine it with art.
